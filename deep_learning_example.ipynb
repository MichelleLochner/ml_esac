Essentially it learns a non-linear transformation which converts input to output. Like any machine learning algorithm, you train it on some training data with known output. The hidden layers are made up of \"neurons\", which connect to every feature of the input, performing said non-linear transforms. Each neuron has a weight and these are learned from training data. "

Neurons (which actually tend to be called nodes or filters in CNN literature) now have volume instead of just being points. This is because they are designed to look at small pieces of the input image (this division of labour makes it possible to go so deep) within their little volume, called a \"receptive field\"."
